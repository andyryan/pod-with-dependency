# Raising issues with Echo
The best way to raise an issue with Echo is through a MYSTATS Jira ticket. 
https://jira.dev.bbc.co.uk/projects/MYSTATS/summary

If you create a github issue it is quite possible that it will go unnoticed.

If you want to raise a pull request this would be welcomed.

## Slack
You can also contact the development team via https://tyoldfield.slack.com which is open to anyone with a BBC email address. We are relatively friendly and will do our best to help with any questions raised in the #echo channel.

## Email support
You can also email the Analytics Servics team through FMAnalyticsSupportTeam@bbc.co.uk.
